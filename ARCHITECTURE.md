DT Lab Architecture
===========

Introduction and Goals
-------

The DT Lab framework enables a user to instantiate a system of digital twins
in the public cloud or on-prem cluster of computers.

The project goal is that a useful system can be instantiated from configured
components of the components with complete security and integration
features.  It is also the goal of DT LAB to support configuration entirely
in a declarative style deployment-time configuration - no dropping down into
first class programming languages required to host useful DTs.

Constraints
-------

* No reliance on VM abstractions (100% containerized)
* Can run on a system-on-a-board (1g RPi)
