DT Lab Architecture
===========

Introduction and Goals
-------

The DT Lab framework enables a user to instantiate a system of digital twins
in the public cloud or on-prem cluster of computers.

The project goal is that a useful system can be instantiated from configured
Dt Lab components with complete security and integration features.  It is
also the goal of DT LAB to support configuration entirely in a declarative
style deployment-time configuration via REST-like API - no dropping down into
first class programming languages required to host useful DTs.

Constraints
-------

* MIT/BSD/Apache2 licensed dependencies (100% Open Source)
* No reliance on VM abstractions (100% containerized)
* Can run on a system-on-a-board (1g RPi)
* Completely programmable via API (no config files)
